                <h3>Girl's Skate Clinic Poster </h3>
                <p>I made this poster. It's about a girls skate clinic.
                    I had to use the Carp Principles. Contrast, alignment, repitition, proximity.
                    For the finished poster, I applied contrast by using black and white for the 
                    background and text. In terms of alignment, I made sure all the sides of the text 
                    were aligned. When it came to repitition, I used repeated a lot of symbols. Lastly for 
                    the proximity part I made sure all of the text were the same difference from each other.

                <h3>Coding Worksheets </h3>
                <h4>Here are some photo's of the coding worksheets that I did.
                    Altogether we did 5 worksheets that consisted of 3 different website themes
                    which were pizza, cake, and a general type website.Each worksheet helped
                    us to understand different parts of web design. Since this is the first proper website
                    I've created, remembering all the code and their functions were pretty hard but
                    the process was definitely a lot easier as we had our worksheets to refer to.
