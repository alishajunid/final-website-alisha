                <p id="one">I made this poster. It's about a girls skate clinic.
                    I had to use the Carp Principles. Contrast, alignment, repitition, proximity.
                    For the finished poster, I applied contrast by using black and white for the
                    background and text. In terms of alignment, I made sure all the sides of the text
                    were aligned on the same line. When it came to repitition, I used repeated a lot of symbols and also
                    kept the font and colour scheme the same for each section. Lastly for the proximity part I made sure all of the text
                    were the same difference from each other. After a discussion with my tutor I was advised to choose my middle layout. She also gave
                    me some advice on how to improve my poster in terms of it's proximity as the texts were not in clear sections.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the second layout I decided to lay it out vertically into 3 sections, the main one's being the image
                    and information. I incorporated the contrast through the colours of the different sections, as well as 
                    through the contrast of the text and sections. In terms of proximity, I made sure all the information was 
                    placed with the same amount of distance between them, whereas in terms of alignment, I made sure they all 
                    were aligned with the sides of the image box. I decided to incorporate repitition by using the same colours
                    and font, as well as breaking up the the information into a few chunks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The third layout I did used the colours dark brown and white to showcase the contrast element of CARP.
                    When it came to the alignment, I chose to line up the sides of the information and the logo so they were all 
                    aligned. I divided the information into 4 chunks and placed 2 of each at different parts of the poster,this 
                    represented repition. I applied the proximity element of CARP by making sure the size of the spaces in between the sections were the same.

                        <p>This is a poster I made following the transitional typographic system.
                            The process of designing this poster was slightly more time consuming 
                            as I had to use the type on path tool. After I played around with and tried
                            a few different styles and positions, I was able to produce this poster.
                            Though it took more time, the result was pretty satisfying to see.

                            For this typographic system I had to ensure that my text was placed in 
                            a fluid and circle type manner. I also had to use the type on path tool
                            for this poster. Before designing I had to refer to some examples online 
                            to ensure that I was carrying out this typographic system in the correct manner.

                        <p>This a poster I made following the modular typographic system.
                           The concept of the modular tpographic system was slightly confusing at first
                           as it's quite similar and heavily related to the grid typographic system. After
                           looking at a few posters and reading, I understood that the text had to be placed 
                           in spaces or shapes. The end result for this poster turned out a lot neater compared 
                           to my other posters.

                            As mentioned, the similarity between the grid and modular typographic system 
                            was slightly confusing. After I finished my initial design, my tutor advised 
                            me to tweak it a bit as it wasn't clearly representing the grid typographic
                            system. The poster I created was following both modular and grid systems. After
                            changing some parts of the design I was able to produce this poster.

                            <p>This a poster I made following the random typographic system.
                                This typographic system required us to really let our creativity flow and think
                                outside the box. Our tutor repeatedly mentioned that she would advise to us make 
                                our posters as random as possible. I think the process of making this poster was quite fun
                                since we had no rules and requirements to follow. After showing my tutors my poster they told 
                                me to try and make it even more random, so that's what I tried to do.

                            <p>This a poster I made following the radial typographic system.
                                For this type system, we had to make sure that the text was designed in a way 
                                which it resembled sun rays coming out from the sun. This was one of the systems 
                                where I had to look for inspiration and information online to ensure I was designing 
                                correctly. I used an orange and black colour scheme to represent the sunray concept.
                                I was pretty happy with the result for this poster, though it's pretty simple.

                                <p>This a poster I made following the bilateral typographic system.
                                    The concept of the bilateral typographic system was pretty easy to understand 
                                    as it basically just meant that the text had to be centered in the middle of the 
                                    design. Suprisingly though it turned out to be quite challenging to design as I had 
                                    to come up with a way for it to not seem boring. It would have been easy to ust put the 
                                    text going straight down, but I had to come up with a way to make the design more interesting.

                                    The axial system was the first poster that I started working on and now from
                                    just looking at it I can see that it looks slightly busier than the others. 
                                    Maybe it was the fact that I used different tones of red for the poster. I 
                                    also had to look at some references for the system just so I could get a better
                                    understanding of how it's usually designed.

                    Altogether we did 5 worksheets that consisted of 3 different website themes
                    which were pizza, cake, and a button website. Each worksheet helped
                    us to understand different parts of web design. Since this is the first proper website
                    I've created, remembering all the code and their functions was pretty hard but
                    the process was definitely a lot easier as we had our worksheets to refer to. Completing 
                    them did take up quite a bit of time as everything was extremely new but through the help
                    of my tutors and also just through trial and error I was able to finish them successfully.

                    the challenges I faced and what I would improve if I were to repeat the process. We were given 
                    quite a long period of time for this assignment but at the same time we were also still being introduced
                    to graphic and web design so it wasn't really possible for us to start straight away. The initial process of 
                    being introduced to web design was rather nerve-wracking as there were lots of new terms and software
                    that I'd never heard of being used. Honestly, getting familiar with using GitHub and having to make sure 
                    that my files were properly linked for each worksheet took up a lot more time than I'd like to admit. The process 
                    of constantly being faced with technical issues and then eventually figuring them out has made my understanding
                    of things better now. Though there are still a lot of things I'm unsure of, that process allowed me to get the hang of things.
                    If I were to repeat this process, I probably would have been more proactive when it came to learning how to
                    code and design websites. I probably could have used my free time to gain more knowledge so I could have excelled
                    more for this project but I would still say that I'm proud of what I've accomplished as this is my first attempt at 
                    creating a website.

                    The process of creating the typography and CARP posters went a lot more smoothly compared to designing this website as I felt 
                    like my creativity was able to flow better. Though graphic design also requires us to use new software, it wasn't too difficult to 
                    bring my ideas to life as the process was less complicated. Before coming to university, I did do some graphic design
                    just as a hobby, so it didn't feel as intimidating as web design. There were times where I had trouble using the software but I was
                    able to find solutions for my issues by asking my tutors or searching for them online.

                    One thing that I've observed is that the process of designing things using
                    code is a lot different, and it requires you to think more. I realised that this was a subject that needs us to learn how to balance
                    both our creative and practical sides. 
                    The fact that we were asked to complete coding worksheets definitely
                    made the process of making this website a lot easier. Through completing them, the terms, and concepts of 
                    web design started to become more familiar and understandable. Additionally, having the coding worksheets 
                    to refer to helped to refresh my memory on how to carry out certain processes. 

                    In regards to the process of this entire assignment as a whole, I probably would have tried to manage my time 
                    more efficiently so I would have had more time to improve and refine my website and posters before the deadline.
                    One aspect that I think I did well was asking for help and advice. I frequently made sure to ask my tutors for advice 
                    on how to improve my designs and how to solve coding issues. I feel as though this allowed me to improve the quality
                    of my work and ensure I was on the right track for this assessment.
